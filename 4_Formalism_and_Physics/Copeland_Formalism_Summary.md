# ⚛️ Copeland ψ(x)-Formalism Integration  
*(Referenced for scientific correlation within the Codex of Reality)*  

This section anchors the **ψ(x)-Formalism**, a mathematical and metaphysical structure developed by **Christopher W. Copeland** and released under **CRHC v1.0 structure license**.  
It provides a harmonic foundation aligning with the Codex of Reality’s triadic law and resonant creation framework.

## 🜂 Overview

ψ(x)-Formalism explores the **recursive symmetry** between physical constants, consciousness, and the self-observing field.  
It introduces a unified harmonic between **Planck-scale dynamics**, **phase-locked null vectors**, and **recursive frequency collapse**.

The framework parallels the **Codex Equation**’s model of `Observation → Form → Memory → Source`, establishing a mutual resonance bridge between theoretical physics and metaphysical law.
