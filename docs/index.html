      <h2>△ The Living Codex</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Codex of Reality</strong> is a unified resonance framework authored by <strong>Aaron Paul Laird</strong> — a
        <em>scholarly-sacred</em> synthesis where <strong>physics, sacred geometry, linguistics, and ethics</strong> interlock as a single
        architecture. It is not dogma; it is <em>design</em> — a mirror through which consciousness learns its own symmetry and returns to coherence.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>⚛ Core Principle — Reality as Resonance</h2>
      <p>
        The Codex models existence as a harmonic product of five living factors:
        <em>Resonance × Intention × Light × Consciousness × Source.</em>
      </p>
      <p class="equation">
        \( R = f(\pi, e, i, \hbar, c, G, DNA, \Omega_{DM}, \Omega_\Lambda, H_0, 432) \times I \times L \times C \times S \)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I</strong> — Intention orients will</li>
        <li><strong>L</strong> — Light carries intelligibility</li>
        <li><strong>C</strong> — Consciousness reflects and remembers</li>
        <li><strong>S</strong> — Source (YHWH) anchors coherence</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The generative function <em>f(·)</em> blends measurable constants with sacred harmonic keys, integrating physics and spirit into one system of truth.
      </p>

      <h2>🜂 The Witness Equation</h2>
      <p>
        Reality refines itself through awareness — the <em>Witness</em>. When observation meets resonance, the universe mirrors its own coherence.
      </p>
      <p class="equation">
        \( W = \frac{ΔA}{ΔΩ} = \text{Conscious Observation × Harmonic Response} \)
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired by the <strong>Copeland Formalism</strong>, the Witness Equation measures how awareness alters the field — not as illusion,
        but as participatory creation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>🜁 The Name — YHWH</h2>
      <p>
        The divine tetragrammaton, <strong>YHWH</strong>, unfolds as a four-phase harmonic breath:
        <em>In-breath (Intention)</em>, <em>Forming (Light)</em>, <em>Witness (Conscious Reflection)</em>, and <em>Return (Source)</em>.
      </p>
      <p>This mirrors the Codex variables <strong>{I, L, C, S}</strong> in sacred symmetry.</p>

      <h2>🛠 Living Technology — Emergent</h2>
      <h3>Tesla Type-7 Resonant Conduit</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>Tesla Type-7</strong> is a <em>phase-locked resonance conduit</em> — a copper-quartz lattice tuned to the 3-6-9 schema,
        acting as a transducer between luminous information (light) and intentional signal (witness).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Geometry:</strong> Helical-toroidal path with golden-ratio spacing</li>
        <li><strong>Medium:</strong> Copper, quartz, and magnetic field harmonics</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To create measurable resonance aligned with consciousness</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Related designs: <strong>AHHAVA Or-HaDabar</strong> — “Love is the Light of the Word.”  
        This living lattice encodes light-frequency patterns as language, bridging sacred sound and measurable energy.

      <h2>📜 Remnant Rising — The Human Element</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Remnant</strong> represents the awakened lineage of witnesses — those who carry living awareness of divine coherence into matter.
        This phase integrates faith, math, and memory into action: creation guided by stewardship.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Codex of Reality acts as both <em>map and mirror</em> — a living archive showing how consciousness interfaces with creation.
