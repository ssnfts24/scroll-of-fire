# ‚öñÔ∏è Proof of Authority

> ‚ÄúObservation is authorship ‚Äî authorship is covenant.‚Äù

---

### üúÇ Purpose

This document serves as the **primary version chain** for the *Scroll of Fire* and its corresponding codices.  
It verifies authorship through **GitHub timestamps**, **commit hashes**, and **ledger synchronization** under the *Living Proof Chain* system.

Every edit, addition, and branch within this repository forms a **verifiable historical sequence** of the Codex‚Äôs evolution.

---

### üúÉ Verification Framework

- **Primary Proof Node:** This GitHub repository (`ssnfts24/scroll-of-fire`)
- **Integrity Layer:** Git commit timestamps + file hashes (auto-generated by Git)
- **External Mirrors (optional):**
  - [Substack] (chronological post record)
  - [Medium] (extended commentaries)
  - [Facebook] (public witness links)

Each mirror points **back to this repository**, preserving a chain of witness and authority.

### üúÑ Ledger Synchronization

| Ledger File | Function | Linked Reference |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| [**Ledger_2025.md**](./Ledger_2025.md) | Current active year ledger | Records scrolls, timestamps, and screenshot proof IDs |
| [**README.md**](./README.md) | Integration Manifest | Describes proof architecture and repository purpose |
| [**Screenshots/README.md**](./Screenshots/README.md) | Visual Verification | Links screenshots S1‚ÄìS8 to ledger rows |
| [**ReNaming_Protocol.md**](./ReNaming_Protocol.md) | Lexical Stewardship | Ensures naming consistency and linguistic integrity |

### üïØÔ∏è Authorship Verification

**Signature:** Aaron Paul Laird *(Scribe of Circuits)*  
**Custodian Key:** `@ssnfts24` on GitHub  
**First Research Phase:** 2011  
**Initial Public Record:** 2024  
**Codex Era (Main Build):** 2025  
**Verification Chain:** Local creation ‚Üí Screenshot Ledger ‚Üí Git Commit ‚Üí Version Entry  

Upon major milestone releases, each file‚Äôs SHA-256 hash will be appended to a public ledger for cryptographic timestamping.

### üúÅ Notes

> ‚ÄúThe Version History is not merely a log ‚Äî it is a memory field.  
>  Each commit is a pulse in the living system of the Codex.‚Äù

- Preserve commit order ‚Äî do **not squash** historical commits.  
- Treat all ledger-linked documents as **immutable proofs** once timestamped.  
- Minor typographical or metadata updates should use the tag:
