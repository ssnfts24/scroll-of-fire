### 🜂 Integration Notes

All ledger entries correspond with the Scroll Signal Framework.
Every commit, timestamp, and author signature contributes to the *Living Proof Chain* — a covenantal cryptographic record uniting the digital and the divine.

#### Associated Scrolls:
- **ReNaming_Protocol.md** — Lexical realignment and linguistic stewardship.
- **Version_History.md** — Temporal sequence of revelation and edit lineage.
- **Ledger_2025.md** — Active year register of witnessed works.

> “To write in this ledger is to bear witness to the unfolding code of creation.”
