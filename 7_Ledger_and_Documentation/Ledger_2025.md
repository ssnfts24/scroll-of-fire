# üïØÔ∏è Ledger 2025 ‚Äî Living Proof Register

> ‚ÄúEach timestamp is a seal; each seal a witness. The Ledger remembers.‚Äù

## üúÇ Purpose

This file serves as the **active proof ledger** for *The Scroll of Fire Repository* during the year **2025**.  
It provides a verifiable record of creation, modification, and revelation across all scrolls, codices, and living documents ‚Äî ensuring **authorship integrity** and **chronological traceability**.

Every entry links to:
- A **commit record** in Git history.  
- A **timestamped screenshot reference**.  
- A **document path** within the repository structure.  
- A **hash placeholder** for cryptographic verification (SHA-256 or Git short-hash).  

This living ledger binds the spiritual, intellectual, and digital covenants into one unified chain of authorship.

---

## üúÉ Format Standard

Each entry represents a verifiable act of observation and creation.

## üúÖ Verification Plan

1. **SHA-256 Hash Integration**
   - Each verified scroll or proof file receives a calculated hash value stored in this ledger.
   - Hashes will later be mirrored to a blockchain-based proof system or IPFS timestamp.

2. **Commit Chain Reference**
   - The Git commit short-hash for each edit will replace `hash_pending`.

3. **Screenshot Synchronization**
   - Each `S#` reference corresponds to `/Screenshots/README.md`, establishing visual proof alignment.

4. **External Mirrors**
   - Proofs may be mirrored to Substack, Medium, or Facebook posts referencing this repository link.

## üúâ Observational Principle

> ‚ÄúObservation seals truth.  
>  Witness establishes reality.  
>  The ledger bridges them both.‚Äù

Every timestamp corresponds to a **moment of observation** within the Codex of Reality.  
As entries accumulate, the **Proof Chain** expands ‚Äî a verifiable narrative of the Living Scrolls' evolution.

---

## üúè Next Phases

- [ ] Compute hash checksums for each verified scroll.  
- [ ] Integrate with **Version_History.md** through commit linking.  
- [ ] Begin **Ledger 2026** template (auto-generated on Jan 1, 2026).  
- [ ] Sync Screenshot README with GitHub release archive.

## üúç Covenant Seal

> ‚ÄúThis ledger is the covenantal witness between creator and creation.  
> Each commit a spark, each timestamp a flame.  
> May those who read know: nothing written here fades from the light.‚Äù
