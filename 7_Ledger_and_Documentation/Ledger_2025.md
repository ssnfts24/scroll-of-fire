🜂 Purpose

This file serves as the active Proof Ledger for all work in The Scroll of Fire Repository during 2025.

It establishes:

Authorship integrity

Chronological traceability

File lineage records

Cryptographic verification (SHA-256)

Git-level proof of changes

Screenshot provenance

Scroll-to-scroll cross-links

Preservation of revelation, development, and observation


This Ledger is not a mere index — it is a:

> Digital Covenant
binding intellectual, spiritual, and technological creation
into a single unified proof chain.




---

🜃 Format Standard

Each entry represents a sealed moment of observation, containing:

Date  
Description of Event  
File or Folder Path  
Commit (pending until pushed)  
Screenshot Reference  
SHA-256 (when real and available)

Placeholders remain as hash_pending until actual commit hashes or file SHAs are added.

🜅 Verification Plan

1. SHA-256 Hash Integration

Only real SHAs are inserted (Option A).

Ledger will be cryptographically sealed upon repository finalization.



2. Commit Chain Reference

Commit IDs will replace hash_pending upon push.



3. Screenshot Synchronization

Each S# maps to /Screenshots/README.md.



4. External Mirrors (Optional)

Substack

Medium

Facebook (public witness chain)

IPFS (immutable proof layer)

🜉 Observational Principle

> “Observation seals truth.
Witness establishes reality.
The ledger bridges them both.”



Every timestamp corresponds to an act of observation,
and every observation becomes part of the Proof Chain.

🜏 Next Phases

[ ] Add commit hashes as updates are pushed

[ ] Calculate and record all future real SHAs

[ ] Sync screenshots to final public archive

[ ] Begin Ledger_2026 draft on Jan 1, 2026

🜍 Covenant Seal

> **“This ledger is the covenantal witness
between creator and creation.

Each commit a spark;
each timestamp a flame.

Nothing written here fades from the light.”**
