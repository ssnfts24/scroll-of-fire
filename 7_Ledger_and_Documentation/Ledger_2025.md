🔥 Purpose

The Ledger_2025 is the central chronological and cryptographic verification register for all Scroll of Fire work during the year 2025.

It provides a provable chain of authorship, linking:

creation

modification

revelation

cross-scroll integration

cryptographic hashes

commit references

screenshot evidence


This ledger binds digital, intellectual, and spiritual authorship into one unified proof chain.


---

🔽 Format Standard

Each event includes:

Date (UTC)
Description
File / Folder
Commit Reference (pending until pushed)
Screenshot Ref
SHA-256 for file or event (when applicable)

This creates a verifiable, tamper-resistant proof sequence.

🔧 Verification Chain

<details>
<summary><strong>🔹 1. Cryptographic Hashes</strong></summary>Each scroll is validated through both:

SHA-256 file checksum

Git commit hash


Dual hashing provides:

tamper-resistant confirmation

authorship protection

long-term archival durability

external proof for legal or academic purposes


</details>
---

<details>
<summary><strong>🔹 2. Screenshot Witnessing</strong></summary>Each screenshot has a corresponding ID (S1–S10).
All screenshots live under:

/7_Ledger_and_Documentation/Screenshots/

This provides visual verification of claims, edits, and creation events.

</details>
---

<details>
<summary><strong>🔹 3. Commit Lineage</strong></summary>Each ledger entry will be updated retroactively with:

Git commit short-hash

Optional GPG signature (if implemented)


This ensures a fully traceable development lineage.

🔮 Observational Principle

> Observation → Ledger → Seal → Reality

A witnessed act becomes a sealed act.
A sealed act becomes part of the Codex chain.
The Codex chain becomes part of the living world.



This ledger is the anchor point of that transformation.
