# 🕯️ Ledger 2025 (Timestamps & Proof Chain)

> “Each date is a seal; each seal, a witness.”

---

### 🜂 Purpose

This file functions as the **active timestamp ledger** for the *Scroll of Fire* repository throughout **2025**.  
Each line represents a verifiable event — an authorship act recorded in both **Git history** and **human-readable form**.

It binds each creative entry to its **moment of observation**, ensuring long-term traceability across scrolls, code, and covenantal documentation.

### 🜃 Format

2025-10-10 — Initial structure + READMEs — /7_Ledger_and_Documentation — (this commit) — S1–S8

### 🜄 Ledger Entries

| Date | Description | Folder/File(s) | Commit / Proof Link | Screenshot Ref |
|-------|--------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **2025-10-10** | Initial structure and documentation update | `/7_Ledger_and_Documentation/` | *(this commit)* | S1–S8 |
| **2025-10-11** | Updated main README with verified Codex paths & key references | `/7_Ledger_and_Documentation/README.md` | *(pending commit)* | — |
| **2025-10-11** | Expanded Proof of Authority file | `/7_Ledger_and_Documentation/Version_History.md` | *(pending commit)* | — |

---

### 🜅 Next Phase

- [ ] Add SHA-256 checksums for all key scrolls (Codex of Reality, Life, and Formalism)
- [ ] Integrate **Git commit hash mapping** to each row
- [ ] Mirror ledger entries to **Version_History.md**
- [ ] Begin 2026 ledger after last verified commit of December 2025

---

### 🜁 Guidance

- Only append entries in chronological order.  
- Each entry must exist as a verifiable Git commit.  
- Screenshot references (S1–S8) correspond to `/Screenshots/README.md`.  
- For external mirrors, use full URLs or verified post IDs.
