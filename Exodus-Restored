All the descendants of Jacob were seventy persons; Joseph was already in Egypt.

→ Hebrew: שִׁבְעִים (Shiv’im) → Seventy, number of completeness.

1:6

Then Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation.

1:8

Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.

“Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and, if war breaks out, they join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land.”

1:11

Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with heavy burdens. They built for Pharaoh store cities, Pithom and Raamses.

1:15

Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah,

1:16

“When you serve as midwife to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him, but if it is a daughter, she shall live.”

1:19

The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.”

1:20

So God dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied and grew very strong.

1:21

And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families.

1:22

Then Pharaoh command ⚖️ed all his people, “Every son that is born to the Hebrews you shall cast into the Nile, but you shall let every daughter live.”

Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her young women walked beside the river.

She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant woman, and she took it.

Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?”

2:8

And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.”

So the girl went and called the child’s mother.

2:9

And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.”

So the woman took the child and nursed him.

2:10

He looked this way and that, and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.

2:13

When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together.

And he said to the man in the wrong, “Why do you strike your companion?”

He answered, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us?

Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?”

Then Moses was afraid and thought, “Surely the thing is known.”

2:24 – And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. וַיִּשְׁמַע אֱלֹהִים אֶת-נַאֲקָתָם וַיִּזְכֹּר אֱלֹהִים אֶת-בְּרִיתוֹ אֶת-אַבְרָהָם אֶת-יִצְחָק וְאֵת יַעֲקֹב

and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians

and you and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him,

after that he will let you go.”

3:21

“And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians;

and when you go, you shall not go empty,

4:6

 Again, Yahweh said to him, “Put your hand inside your cloak.”

 And he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous like snow.

 Then God said, “Put your hand back inside your cloak.”

 So he put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh.

4:8

 “If they will not believe you,” God said, “or listen to the first sign, they may believe the latter sign.”

 Is it not I, Yahweh?”

4:12

 “Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.”

4:13

 But he said, “Oh, my יהוה, please send someone else.”

4:14

 Then the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Moses and he said,

 “Is there not Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well.

 Behold, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.”

4:15

 “You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth,

 “Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead.”

 And Moses took the staff of God in his hand.

4:21

 And Yahweh said to Moses,

 “When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the miracles that I have put in your power.

 But I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go.”

4:22

 “Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says Yahweh, Israel is my firstborn son,

lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.”

5:4

But the king of Egypt said to them,

“Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from their work? Get back to your burdens.”

5:5

And Pharaoh said,

“Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens!”

5:6

The same day Pharaoh command ⚖️ed the taskmasters of the people and their foremen,

5:7

“You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as in the past; let them go and gather straw for themselves.”

5:8

“But the number of bricks that they made in the past you shall impose on them, you shall by no means reduce it, for they are idle.

Therefore they cry, ‘Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.’”

5:9

“Let heavier work be laid on the men that they may labor at it and pay no regard to lying words.”

5:12

So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.

5:13

The taskmasters were urgent, saying,

“Complete your work, your daily task each day, as when there was straw.”

5:14

And the foremen of the people of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked,

“Why have you not done all your task of making bricks today and yesterday, as in the past?”

5:15

Then the foremen of the people of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh,

“Why do you treat your servants like this?”

5:16

“No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’

And behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.”

5:17

But he said, “You are idle, you are idle; that is why you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to Yahweh.’”

5:18

“Go now and work. No straw will be given you, but you must still deliver the same number of bricks.”

5:19

The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in trouble when they said,

“You shall by no means reduce your number of bricks, your daily task each day.”

5:20

They met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them, as they came out from Pharaoh;

and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.”

and you have not delivered your people at all.”

and gave them a charge about the people of Israel and about Pharaoh king of Egypt:

to bring the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

It was they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the people of Israel from Egypt,

this Moses and this Aaron.

6:28

On the day when Yahweh spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,

6:29

Yahweh said to Moses,

“I am Yahweh; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you.”

6:30

But Moses said to Yahweh,

“Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips. How will Pharaoh listen to me?”



📜 Chapter 7 – The Staff Becomes a Serpent

שמות ז׳ – הַמַּטֶּה לְנָחָשׁ



7:1

And Yahweh said to Moses,

“See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh,

and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet.”

→ Prophetic insight: Yahweh raises His servants to carry divine authority.

→ Remnant lesson: When you speak for Yahweh, you stand in sacred representation.

7:2

“You shall speak all that I command ⚖️ you,

and your brother Aaron shall tell Pharaoh to let the people of Israel go out of his land.”

7:3

“But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart,

and though I multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,

7:4

Pharaoh will not listen to you.

Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and bring my hosts, my people the children of Israel,

out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment.”

7:5

“The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh,

when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring out the people of Israel from among them.”

7:6

Moses and Aaron did so; they did just as Yahweh command ⚖️ed them.

7:7

Now Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old,

when they spoke to Pharaoh.

Aaron’s Staff Becomes a Serpent

7:8

Then Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron,

7:9

“When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Prove yourselves by working a miracle,’

then you shall



📜 Chapter 8 – The Plagues Begin: Frogs, Lice, Flies

שמות ח׳ – הַמַּכּוֹת הַרִאשׁוֹנוֹת: צְפַרְדֵּעַ, כִּנִּים, עָרוֹב



8:1

Then Yahweh said to Moses,

“Go in to Pharaoh and say to him,

‘Thus says Yahweh, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

8:2

But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague 🔥 all your country with frogs.

8:3

The Nile shall swarm with frogs that shall come up into your house and into your bedroom and on your bed

and into the houses of your servants and your people, and into your ovens and your kneading bowls.

8:4

The frogs shall come up on you and on your people and on all your servants.’”

8:5

And Yahweh said to Moses,

“Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the canals and over the pools,

and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt!’”

8:6

So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt,

Ah-mein.



📜 Chapter 9 – Plagues of Pestilence, Boils, and Hail

שמות ט׳ – דֶּבֶר, שְׁחִין, וּבָרָד



9:1

Then Yahweh said to Moses,

“Go in to Pharaoh and say to him,

‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews,

“Let my people go, that they may serve me.

9:2

For if you refuse to let them go and still hold them,

9:3

Behold, the hand of Yahweh will fall with a very severe plague 🔥

Upon your livestock that are in the field,

The horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks.

9:4

But Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt,

So that nothing of all that belongs to the people of Israel shall die.”’”

9:5

And Yahweh set a time, saying,

“Tomorrow Yahweh will do this thing in the land.”

9:6

And the next day Yahweh did this thing.

All the livestock of the Egyptians died,

But not one of the livestock of the people of Israel died.

9:7

And Pharaoh sent, and behold, not one of the livestock of Israel was dead.

But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.

9:8

And Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron,

“Take handfuls of soot from the kiln, and let Moses throw them in the air in the sight of Pharaoh.

9:9

It shall become fine dust over all the land of Egypt,

And become boils breaking out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt.”

9:10

So they took soot from the kiln and stood before Pharaoh.

And Moses threw it in the air, and it became boils breaking out in sores on man and beast.

9:11

And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils,

For the boils came upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians.

9:12

But Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh,

And he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken to Moses.

9:13

Then Yahweh said to Moses,

“Rise up early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh and say to him,

‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews,

“Let my people go, that they may serve me.

9:14

For this time I will send all my plague 🔥s on you yourself, and on your servants and your people,

So that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.

9:15

For by now I could have put out my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence,

And you would have been cut off from the earth.

9:16

But for this purpose I have raised you up,

To show you my power, so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.

9:17

You are still exalting yourself against my people and will not let them go.

9:18

Behold, about this time tomorrow I will cause very heavy hail to fall,

Such as never has been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.

9:19

Now therefore send, get your livestock and all that you have in the field into safe shelter,

For every man and beast that is in the field and is not brought home will die when the hail falls on them.”’”

9:20

Then whoever feared the word of Yahweh among the servants of Pharaoh

Hurried his slaves and his livestock into the houses,

9:21

But whoever did not pay attention to the word of Yahweh

Left his slaves and his livestock in the field.

9:22

Then Yahweh said to Moses,

“Stretch out your hand toward heaven,

So that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt,

On man and beast and every plant of the field, in the land of Egypt.”

9:23

Then Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven,

And Yahweh sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth.

And Yahweh rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

9:24

There was hail and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail,

Very heavy hail, such as had never been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.

9:25

The hail struck down everything that was in the field in all the land of Egypt,

Both man and beast.

And the hail struck down every plant of the field and broke every tree of the field.

9:26

Only in the land of Goshen, where the people of Israel were, was there no hail.

9:27

Then Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron and said to them,

“This time I have sinned; Yahweh is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.

9:28

Plead with Yahweh, for there has been enough of God’s thunder and hail.

I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.”

9:29

Moses said to him,

“As soon as I have gone out of the city,

I will stretch out my hands to Yahweh.

The thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail,

so that you may know that the earth is Yahweh’s.

9:30

But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear Yahweh God.”

9:31

(The flax and the barley were struck down,

for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud.

9:32

But the wheat and the emmer were not struck down,

for they are late in coming up.)

9:33

So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and stretched out his hands to Yahweh,

and the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured upon the earth.

9:34

But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased,

he sinned yet again and hardened his heart, he and his servants.

9:35

So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened,

and he did not let the people of Israel go,

just as Yahweh had spoken through Moses.



📜 Chapter 10 – Locusts and Darkness

שמות י׳ – אַרְבֶּה וַחֲשֵׁכָה



10:1

Then Yahweh said to Moses,

“Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants,

That I may show these signs of mine among them,

10:2

And that you may tell in the hearing of your son and of your grandson

How I have dealt harshly with the Egyptians

And what signs I have done among them,

That you may know that I am Yahweh.”

10:3

So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him,

“Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews,

‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me?

Let my people go, that they may serve me.

10:4

For if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow

I will bring locusts into your country,

10:5

And they shall cover the face of the land, so that no one can see the land.

And they shall eat what is left to you after the hail,

And they shall eat every tree of yours that grows in the field,

10:6

And they shall fill your houses and the houses of all your servants and of all the Egyptians,

As neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day they came on earth to this day.’”

Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh.

10:7

Then Pharaoh’s servants said to him,

“How long shall this man be a snare to us?

Let the men go, that they may serve Yahweh their God.

Do you not yet understand that Egypt is ruined?”

10:8

So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh,

And he said to them,

“Go, serve Yahweh your God. But which ones are to go?”

10:9

Moses said,

“We will go with our young and our old.

We will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds,

For we must hold a feast to Yahweh.”

10:10

But he said to them,

“Yahweh be with you, if ever I let you and your little ones go!

Look, you have some evil purpose in mind.

10:11

No! Go, the men among you, and serve Yahweh, for that is what you are asking.”

And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.

10:12

Then Yahweh said to Moses,

“Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts,

So that they may come upon the land of Egypt and eat every plant in the land,

All that the hail has left.”

10:13

So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt,

And Yahweh brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night.

When it was morning, the east wind had brought the locusts.

10:14

The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled on the whole country of Egypt,

Such a dense swarm of locusts as had never been before, nor ever will be again.

10:15

They covered the face of the whole land, so that the land was darkened,

And they ate all the plants in the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left.

Not a green thing remained, neither tree nor plant of the field, through all the land of Egypt.

10:16

Then Pharaoh hastily called Moses and Aaron and said,

“I have sinned against Yahweh your God, and against you.

10:17

Now therefore, forgive my sin, please, only this once,

And plead with Yahweh your God only to remove this death from me.”

10:18

So he went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with Yahweh.

10:19

And Yahweh turned the wind into a very strong west wind,

Which lifted the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea 🌊.

Not a single locust was left in all the country of Egypt.

10:20

But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart,

And he did not let the people of Israel go.

10:21

Then Yahweh said to Moses,

“Stretch out your hand toward heaven,

That there may be darkness over the land of Egypt,

A darkness to be felt.”

10:22

So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven,

And there was pitch darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.

10:23

They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days,

But all the people of Israel had light where they lived.

10:24

Then Pharaoh called Moses and said,

“Go, serve Yahweh; your little ones also may go with you; only let your flocks and your herds remain behind.”

10:25

But Moses said,

“You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings,

That we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God.

10:26

Our livestock also must go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind,

For we must take of them to serve Yahweh our God,

And we do not know with what we must serve Yahweh until we arrive there.”

10:27

But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.

10:28

Then Pharaoh said to him,

“Get away from me; take care never to see my face again,

For on the day you see my face you shall die.”

10:29

Moses said,

“As you say! I will not see your face again.”



📜 Chapter 11 – The Final Warning

שמות י״א – הָאַזהָרָה הָאַחֲרוֹנָה



11:1

Yahweh said to Moses,

“Yet one plague 🔥 more I will bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt.

Afterward he will let you go from here.

When he lets you go, he will drive you away completely.

11:2

Speak now in the hearing of the people,

That they ask, every man of his neighbor and every woman of her neighbor,

For silver and gold jewelry.”

11:3

And Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians.

Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt,

In the sight of Pharaoh’s servants and in the sight of the people.

11:4

So Moses said,

“Thus says Yahweh:

About midnight I will go out in the midst of Egypt,

11:5

And every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die,

From the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne,

Even to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the handmill,

And all the firstborn of the cattle.

11:6

There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,

Such as there has never been, nor ever will be again.

11:7

But not a dog shall growl against any of the people of Israel,

Either man or beast, that you may know that Yahweh makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.

11:8

And all these your servants shall come down to me and bow down to me, saying,

‘Get out, you and all the people who follow you.’

And after that I will go out.”

And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.

11:9

Then Yahweh said to Moses,

“Pharaoh will not listen to you,

That my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.”

11:10

Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh,

And Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart,

And he did not let the people of Israel go out of his land.



📜 Chapter 12 – The First Passover & Death of the Firstborn

שמות י״ב – הַפֶּסַח וּמַכַּת בְּכוֹרוֹת



12:1

Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,

12:2

“This month shall be for you the beginning of months;

It shall be the first month of the year for you.

12:3

Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month

Every man shall take a lamb according to their fathers’ houses, a lamb for a household.

12:4

And if the household is too small for a lamb,

Then he and his nearest neighbor shall take according to the number of persons;

According to what each can eat you shall make your count for the lamb.

12:5

Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old.

You may take it from the sheep or from the goats,

12:6

And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month,

When the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill their lambs at twilight.

12:7

Then they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts

And the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.

12:8

They shall eat the flesh that night, roasted on the fire;

With unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it.

12:9

Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted,

Its head with its legs and its inner parts.

12:10

And you shall let none of it remain until the morning;

Anything that remains until the morning you shall burn.

12:11

In this manner you shall eat it: with your belt fastened, your sandals on your feet,

And your staff in your hand.

And you shall eat it in haste. It is Yahweh’s Passover.

12:12

For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night,

And I will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast;

And on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am Yahweh.

12:13

The blood shall be a sign for you, on the houses where you are.

And when I see the blood, I will pass over you,

And no plague 🔥 will befall you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt.

12:14

This day shall be for you a memorial day,

And you shall keep it as a feast to Yahweh;

Throughout your generations, as a statute forever, you shall keep it as a feast.

12:15

Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.

On the first day you shall remove leaven out of your houses,

For if anyone eats what is leavened, from the first day until the seventh day,

That person shall be cut off from Israel.

12:16

On the first day you shall hold a holy assembly,

And on the seventh day a holy assembly.

No work shall be done on those days.

But what everyone needs to eat, that alone may be prepared by you.

12:17

And you shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread,

For on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt.

Therefore you shall observe this day, throughout your generations, as a statute forever.

12:18

In the first month, from the fourteenth day of the month at evening,

You shall eat unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.

12:19

For seven days no leaven is to be found in your houses.

If anyone eats what is leavened, that person will be cut off from the congregation of Israel,

Whether he is a sojourner or a native of the land.

12:20

You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwelling places you shall eat unleavened bread.”

12:21

Then Moses called all the elders of Israel and said to them,

“Go and select lambs for yourselves according to your clans, and kill the Passover lamb.

12:22

Take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin,

And touch the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin.

None of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.

12:23

For Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians,

And when he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts,

Yahweh will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses to strike you.

12:24

You shall observe this rite as a statute for you and for your sons forever.

12:25

And when you come to the land that Yahweh will give you, as he has promised,

You shall keep this service.

12:26

And when your children say to you, ‘What do you mean by this service?’

12:27

You shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of Yahweh’s Passover,

For he passed over the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt,

When he struck the Egyptians but spared our houses.’”

And the people bowed their heads and worshiped.

12:28

Then the people of Israel went and did so;

As Yahweh had command ⚖️ed Moses and Aaron, so they did.

12:29

At midnight Yahweh struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,

From the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne

To the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon,

And all the firstborn of the livestock.

12:30

And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians.

And there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where someone was not dead.

12:31

Then he summoned Moses and Aaron by night and said,

“Up, go out from among my people, both you and the people of Israel;

And go, serve Yahweh, as you have said.

12:32

Take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone,

And bless me also!”

12:33

The Egyptians were urgent with the people to send them out of the land in haste.

For they said, “We shall all be dead.”

12:34

So the people took their dough before it was leavened,

Their kneading bowls being bound up in their cloaks on their shoulders.

12:35

The people of Israel had also done as Moses told them,

For they had asked the Egyptians for silver and gold jewelry and for clothing.

12:36

And Yahweh had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians,

So that they let them have what they asked. Thus they plundered the Egyptians.

12:37

And the people of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,

About six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.

12:38

A mixed multitude also went up with them, and very much livestock, both flocks and herds.

12:39

And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had brought out of Egypt,

For it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not wait,

Nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.

12:40

The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430 years.

12:41

At the end of 430 years, on that very day,

All the hosts of Yahweh went out from the land of Egypt.

12:42

It was a night of watching by Yahweh, to bring them out of the land of Egypt;

So this same night is a night of watching kept to Yahweh by all the people of Israel throughout their generations.

12:43

And Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron,

“This is the statute of the Passover: no foreigner shall eat of it,

12:44

But every slave that is bought for money may eat of it after you have circumcised him.

12:45

No foreigner or hired worker may eat of it.

12:46

It shall be eaten in one house; you shall not take any of the flesh outside the house,

And you shall not break any of its bones.

12:47

All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

12:48

If a stranger shall sojourn with you and would keep the Passover to Yahweh,

Let all his males be circumcised.

Then he may come near and keep it; he shall be as a native of the land.

But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.

12:49

There shall be one law for the native and for the stranger who sojourns among you.”

12:50

All the people of Israel did just as Yahweh command ⚖️ed Moses and Aaron.

12:51

And on that very day Yahweh brought the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.



📜 Chapter 13 – Consecration & Pillar of Fire

שמות י״ג – קִדּוּשׁ וְעַמּוּד הָאֵשׁ



13:1

Yahweh said to Moses,

13:2

“Consecrate to me all the firstborn.

Whatever is the first to open the womb among the people of Israel,

Both of man and of beast, is mine.”

13:3

Then Moses said to the people,

“Remember this day in which you came out from Egypt,

Out of the house of slavery,

For by a strong hand Yahweh brought you out from this place.

No leavened bread shall be eaten.

13:4

Today, in the month of Abib, you are going out.

13:5

And when Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanites,

The Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites,

Which he swore to your fathers to give you,

A land flowing with milk and honey,

You shall keep this service in this month.

13:6

Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread,

And on the seventh day there shall be a feast to Yahweh.

13:7

Unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days.

No leavened bread shall be seen with you,

And no leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory.

13:8

You shall tell your son on that day,

‘It is because of what Yahweh did for me when I came out of Egypt.’

13:9

And it shall be to you as a sign on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes,

That the law of Yahweh may be in your mouth.

For with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt.

13:10

You shall therefore keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.

13:11

“When Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanites,

As he swore to you and your fathers, and shall give it to you,

13:12

You shall set apart to Yahweh all that first opens the womb.

All the firstborn of your animals that are males shall be Yahweh’s.

13:13

Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb,

Or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck.

Every firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem.

13:14

And when in time to come your son asks you,

‘What does this mean?’ you shall say to him,

‘By a strong hand Yahweh brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery.

13:15

For when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go,

Yahweh killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,

Both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of animals.

Therefore I sacrifice to Yahweh all the males that first open the womb,

But all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.’

13:16

It shall be as a mark on your hand or frontlets between your eyes,

For by a strong hand Yahweh brought us out of Egypt.”

13:17

When Pharaoh let the people go,

God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near.

For God said,

“Lest the people change their minds when they see war and return to Egypt.”

13:18

But God led the people around by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea 🌊.

And the people of Israel went up out of the land of Egypt equipped for battle.

13:19

Moses took the bones of Joseph with him,

For Joseph had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying,

“God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones with you from here.”

13:20

And they moved on from Succoth and encamped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.

13:21

And Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way,

And by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night.

13:22

The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people.

שמות י״ד – קְרִיעַת יָם-סוּף



14:1

Then Yahweh said to Moses,

14:2

“Tell the people of Israel to turn back and encamp in front of Pi-hahiroth,

Between Migdol and the sea, in front of Baal-zephon;

You shall encamp facing it, by the sea.

14:3

For Pharaoh will say of the people of Israel,

‘They are wandering in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.’

14:4

And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue them,

And I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host,

And the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh.”

And they did so.

14:5

When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled,

The mind of Pharaoh and his servants was changed toward the people,

And they said,

“What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?”

14:6

So he made ready his chariot and took his army with him,

14:7

And took six hundred chosen chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt

With officers over all of them.

14:8

And Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt,

And he pursued the people of Israel

While the people of Israel were going out defiantly.

14:9

The Egyptians pursued them,

All Pharaoh’s horses and chariots and his horsemen and his army,

And overtook them encamped at the sea, by Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.

14:10

When Pharaoh drew near, the people of Israel lifted up their eyes,

And behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they feared greatly.

And the people of Israel cried out to Yahweh.

14:11

They said to Moses,

“Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness?

What have you done to us in bringing us out of Egypt?

14:12

Is not this what we said to you in Egypt: ‘Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians’?

For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.”

14:13

And Moses said to the people,

“Fear not, stand firm, and see the salvation of Yahweh,

Which he will work for you today.

For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall never see again.

14:14

Yahweh will fight for you, and you have only to be silent.”

14:15

Yahweh said to Moses,

“Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward.

14:16

Lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it,

That the people of Israel may go through the sea on dry ground.

14:17

And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they shall go in after them,

And I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, his chariots, and his horsemen.

14:18

And the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh,

When I have gotten glory over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”

14:19

Then the angel ⚔️ of God who was going before the host of Israel moved and went behind them,

And the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them,

14:20

Coming between the host of Egypt and the host of Israel.

And there was the cloud and the darkness.

And it lit up the night without one coming near the other all night.

14:21

Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,

And Yahweh drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night and made the sea dry land,

And the waters were divided.

14:22

And the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground,

The waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.

14:23

The Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea,

All Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

14:24

And in the morning watch Yahweh in the pillar of fire and of cloud

Looked down on the Egyptian forces and threw the Egyptian forces into a panic,

14:25

Clogging their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily.

And the Egyptians said,

“Let us flee from before Israel, for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians.”

14:26

Then Yahweh said to Moses,

“Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may come back upon the Egyptians,

Upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.”

14:27

So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,

And the sea returned to its normal course when the morning appeared.

And as the Egyptians fled into it, Yahweh threw the Egyptians into the midst of the sea.

14:28

The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen;

Of all the host of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea, not one of them remained.

14:29

But the people of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea,

The waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.

14:30

Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians,

And Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.

14:31

Israel saw the great power that Yahweh used against the Egyptians,

So the people feared Yahweh, and they believed in Yahweh and in his servant Moses.



📜 Chapter 15 – Song of the Sea (Shirat HaYam)

שמות ט״ו – שִׁירַת הַיָּם



15:1

Then Moses and the people of Israel sang this song to Yahweh, saying,

“I will sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously;

The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.

15:2

Yahweh is my strength and my song,

And he has become my salvation;

This is my God, and I will praise him,

My father’s God, and I will exalt him.

15:3

Yahweh is a man of war;

Yahweh is his name.

15:4

Pharaoh’s chariots and his host he cast into the sea,

And his chosen officers were sunk in the Red Sea 🌊.

15:5

The floods covered them;

They went down into the depths like a stone.

15:6

Your right hand, O Yahweh, glorious in power,

Your right hand, O Yahweh, shatters the enemy.

15:7

In the greatness of your majesty you overthrow your adversaries;

You send out your fury; it consumes them like stubble.

15:8

At the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up;

The floods stood up in a heap;

The deeps congealed in the heart of the sea.

15:9

The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake,

I will divide the spoil, my desire shall have its fill of them.

I will draw my sword; my hand shall destroy them.’

15:10

You blew with your wind; the sea covered them;

They sank like lead in the mighty waters.

15:11

Who is like you, O Yahweh, among the gods?

Who is like you, majestic in holiness,

Awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?

15:12

You stretched out your right hand;

The earth swallowed them.

15:13

You have led in your steadfast love the people whom you have redeemed;

You have guided them by your strength to your holy abode.

15:14

The peoples have heard; they tremble;

Pangs have seized the inhabitants of Philistia.

15:15

Now are the chiefs of Edom dismayed;

Trembling seizes the leaders of Moab;

All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.

15:16

Terror and dread fall upon them;

Because of the greatness of your arm, they are still as a stone,

Till your people, O Yahweh, pass by,

Till the people pass by, whom you have purchased.

15:17

You will bring them in and plant them on your own mountain 🔥,

The place, O Yahweh, which you have made for your abode,

The sanctuary, O Yahweh, which your hands have established.

15:18

Yahweh will reign forever and ever.”

15:19

For when the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea,

Yahweh brought back the waters of the sea upon them,

But the people of Israel walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea.

15:20

Then Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron,

Took a tambourine in her hand,

And all the women went out after her with tambourines and dancing.

15:21

And Miriam sang to them:

“Sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously;

The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.”

15:22

Then Moses made Israel set out from the Red Sea 🌊,

And they went into the wilderness of Shur.

They went three days in the wilderness and found no water.

15:23

When they came to Marah, they could not drink the water of Marah because it was bitter;

Therefore it was named Marah.

15:24

And the people grumbled against Moses, saying,

“What shall we drink?”

15:25

And he cried to Yahweh, and Yahweh showed him a log,

And he threw it into the water, and the water became sweet.

There Yahweh made for them a statute and a rule, and there he tested them,

15:26

Saying,

“If you will diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God,

And do that which is right in his eyes,

And give ear to his command ⚖️ments and keep all his statutes,

I will put none of the diseases on you that I put on the Egyptians,

For I am Yahweh, your healer.”

15:27

Then they came to Elim,

Where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees,

And they encamped there by the water.



📜 Chapter 16 – Manna from Heaven

שמות ט״ז – הַמָּן מִן הַשָּׁמַיִם



16:1

They set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the people of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin,

which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had departed from the land of Egypt.

16:2

And the whole congregation of the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness,

16:3

and the people of Israel said to them,

“Would that we had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt,

when we sat by the meat pots and ate bread to the full,

for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.”

16:4

Then Yahweh said to Moses,

“Behold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you,

and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day,

that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not.

16:5

On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in,

it will be twice as much as they gather daily.”

16:6

So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel,

“At evening you shall know that it was Yahweh who brought you out of the land of Egypt,

16:7

and in the morning you shall see the glory of Yahweh,

because he has heard your grumbling against Yahweh.

For what are we, that you grumble against us?”

16:8

And Moses said,

“When Yahweh gives you in the evening meat to eat and in the morning bread to the full,

because Yahweh has heard your grumbling that you grumble against him—what are we?

Your grumbling is not against us but against Yahweh.”

16:9

Then Moses said to Aaron,

“Say to the whole congregation of the people of Israel,

‘Come near before Yahweh, for he has heard your grumbling.’”

16:10

And as soon as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the people of Israel,

they looked toward the wilderness,

and behold, the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud.

16:11

And Yahweh said to Moses,

16:12

“I have heard the grumbling of the people of Israel.

Say to them, ‘At twilight you shall eat meat,

and in the morning you shall be filled with bread.

Then you shall know that I am Yahweh your God.’”

16:13

In the evening quail came up and covered the camp,

and in the morning dew lay around the camp.

16:14

And when the dew had gone up,

there was on the face of the wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as frost on the ground.

16:15

When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another,

“What is it?” For they did not know what it was.

And Moses said to them,

“It is the bread that Yahweh has given you to eat.

16:16

This is what Yahweh has command ⚖️ed:

‘Gather of it, each one of you, as much as he can eat.

You shall each take an omer, according to the number of the persons that each of you has in his tent.’”

16:17

And the people of Israel did so.

They gathered, some more, some less.

16:18

But when they measured it with an omer, whoever gathered much had nothing left over,

and whoever gathered little had no lack.

Each of them gathered as much as he could eat.

16:19

And Moses said to them,

“Let no one leave any of it over till the morning.”

16:20

But they did not listen to Moses.

Some left part of it till the morning, and it bred worms and stank.

And Moses was angry with them.

16:21

Morning by morning they gathered it, each as much as he could eat;

but when the sun grew hot, it melted.

16:22

On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers each.

And when all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses,

16:23

he said to them,

“This is what Yahweh has command ⚖️ed:

‘Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh;

bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil,

and all that is left over lay aside to be kept till the morning.’”

16:24

So they laid it aside till the morning, as Moses command ⚖️ed them,

and it did not stink, and there were no worms in it.

16:25

Moses said,

“Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh;

today you will not find it in the field.

16:26

Six days you shall gather it,

but on the seventh day, which is a Sabbath, there will be none.”

16:27

On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they found none.

16:28

And Yahweh said to Moses,

“How long will you refuse to keep my command ⚖️ments and my laws?

16:29

See! Yahweh has given you the Sabbath;

therefore on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days.

Remain each of you in his place; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.”

16:30

So the people rested on the seventh day.

16:31

Now the house of Israel called its name manna.

It was like coriander seed, white,

and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.

16:32

Moses said,

“This is what Yahweh has command ⚖️ed:

‘Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations,

so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness,

when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”

16:33

And Moses said to Aaron,

“Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it,

and place it before Yahweh to be kept throughout your generations.”

16:34

As Yahweh command ⚖️ed Moses,

so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept.

16:35

The people of Israel ate the manna forty years,

till they came to a habitable land.

They ate the manna till they came to the border of the land of Canaan.

16:36

(An omer is the tenth part of an ephah.)



📜 Chapter 17 – Water from the Rock & Amalek Defeated

שמות י״ז – מַיִם מִן הַסֶּלַע וְנִצָּחוֹן עַל עֲמָלֵק



17:1

All the congregation of the people of Israel moved on from the wilderness of Sin by stages,

According to the command ⚖️ment of Yahweh, and camped at Rephidim,

But there was no water for the people to drink.

17:2

Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said,

“Give us water to drink.”

And Moses said to them,

“Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?”

17:3

But the people thirsted there for water,

And the people grumbled against Moses and said,

“Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?”

17:4

So Moses cried to Yahweh,

“What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.”

17:5

And Yahweh said to Moses,

“Pass on before the people, taking with you some of the elders of Israel,

And take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.

17:6

Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb,

And you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it,

And the people will drink.”

And Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel.

17:7

And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah,

Because of the quarreling of the people of Israel,

And because they tested Yahweh by saying,

“Is Yahweh among us or not?”

17:8

Then Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim.

17:9

So Moses said to Joshua,

“Choose for us men, and go out and fight with Amalek.

Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.”

17:10

So Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought with Amalek,

While Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

17:11

Whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed,

And whenever he lowered his hand, Amalek prevailed.

17:12

But Moses’ hands grew weary, so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it,

While Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side.

So his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.

17:13

And Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the sword.

17:14

Then Yahweh said to Moses,

“Write this as a memorial in a book and recite it in the ears of Joshua,

That I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.”

17:15

And Moses built an altar and called the name of it, Yahweh Is My Banner,

17:16

Saying,

“A hand upon the throne of Yahweh!

Yahweh will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.”



📜 Chapter 18 – Jethro’s Counsel to Moses

שמות י״ח – עֲצַת יִתְרוֹ לְמֹשֶׁה



18:1

Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law,

Heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people,

How Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt.

18:2

Now Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, had taken Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her home,

18:3

Along with her two sons.

The name of the one was Gershom (for he said, “I have been a sojourner in a foreign land”),

18:4

And the name of the other, Eliezer (for he said,

“The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh”).

18:5

Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness

Where he was encamped at the mountain 🔥 of God.

18:6

And when he sent word to Moses,

“I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her,”

18:7

Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him.

And they asked each other of their welfare and went into the tent.

18:8

Then Moses told his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake,

All the hardship that had come upon them in the way, and how Yahweh had delivered them.

18:9

And Jethro rejoiced for all the good that Yahweh had done to Israel,

In that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.

18:10

Jethro said,

“Blessed be Yahweh, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh

And has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

18:11

Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all gods,

Because in this affair they dealt arrogantly with the people.”

18:12

And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God.

And Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.

18:13

The next day Moses sat to judge the people,

And the people stood around Moses from morning till evening.

18:14

When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said,

“What is this that you are doing for the people?

Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning till evening?”

18:15

And Moses said to his father-in-law,

“Because the people come to me to inquire of God;

18:16

When they have a dispute, they come to me and I decide between one person and another,

And I make them know the statutes of God and his laws.”

18:17

Moses’ father-in-law said to him,

“What you are doing is not good.

18:18

You and the people with you will certainly wear yourselves out,

For the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to do it alone.

18:19

Now obey my voice; I will give you advice, and God be with you!

You shall represent the people before God and bring their cases to God,

18:20

And you shall warn them about the statutes and the laws,

And make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do.

18:21

Moreover, look for able men from all the people, men who fear God,

Who are trustworthy and hate a bribe,

And place such men over the people as chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.

18:22

And let them judge the people at all times.

Every great matter they shall bring to you, but any small matter they shall decide themselves.

So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you.

18:23

If you do this, God will direct you, you will be able to endure,

And all this people also will go to their place in peace.”

18:24

So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.

18:25

Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people,

Chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.

18:26

And they judged the people at all times.

Any hard case they brought to Moses, but any small matter they decided themselves.

18:27

Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went away to his own country.



📜 Chapter 19 – Mount Sinai & Divine Presence

שמות י״ט – הַר סִינַי וּשְׁכִינַת אֱלֹהִים



19:1

On the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt,

On that day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.

19:2

They set out from Rephidim and came into the wilderness of Sinai,

And they encamped in the wilderness.

There Israel encamped before the mountain 🔥,

19:3

While Moses went up to God.

Yahweh called to him out of the mountain 🔥, saying,

“Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel:

19:4

‘You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians,

And how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself.

19:5

Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant ✡️,

You shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine;

19:6

And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’

These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.”

19:7

So Moses came and called the elders of the people and set before them all these words that Yahweh had command ⚖️ed him.

19:8

All the people answered together and said,

“All that Yahweh has spoken we will do.”

And Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh.

19:9

And Yahweh said to Moses,

“Behold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud,

That the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.”

When Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh,

19:10

Yahweh said to Moses,

“Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow,

And let them wash their garments

19:11

And be ready for the third day.

For on the third day Yahweh will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.

19:12

And you shall set limits for the people all around, saying,

‘Take care not to go up into the mountain 🔥 or touch the edge of it.

Whoever touches the mountain 🔥 shall be put to death.

19:13

No hand shall touch him, but he shall be stoned or shot;

Whether beast or man, he shall not live.’

When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain 🔥.”

19:14

So Moses went down from the mountain 🔥 to the people and consecrated the people;

And they washed their garments.

19:15

And he said to the people,

“Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman.”

19:16

On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings

And a thick cloud on the mountain 🔥 and a very loud trumpet blast,

So that all the people in the camp trembled.

19:17

Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God,

And they took their stand at the foot of the mountain 🔥.

19:18

Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because Yahweh had descended on it in fire.

The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain 🔥 trembled greatly.

19:19

And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder,

Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder.

19:20

Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain 🔥.

And Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain 🔥, and Moses went up.

19:21

And Yahweh said to Moses,

“Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to Yahweh to look and many of them perish.

19:22

Also let the priests who come near to Yahweh consecrate themselves,

Lest Yahweh break out against them.”

19:23

And Moses said to Yahweh,

“The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us,

Saying, ‘Set limits around the mountain 🔥 and consecrate it.’”

19:24

And Yahweh said to him,

“Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you.

But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh,

Lest he break out against them.”

19:25

So Moses went down to the people and told them.



📜 Chapter 20 – The Ten Commandments (Aseret HaDibrot)

שמות כ׳ – עֲשֶׂרֶת הַדִּבְּרוֹת



20:1

And God spoke all these words, saying,

20:2

“I am Yahweh your God,

Who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

20:3

You shall have no other gods before me.

20:4

You shall not make for yourself a carved image,

Or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath,

Or that is in the water under the earth.

20:5

You shall not bow down to them or serve them,

For I Yahweh your God am a jealous God,

Visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation

Of those who hate me,

20:6

But showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my command ⚖️ments.

20:7

You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain,

For Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.

20:8

Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.

20:9

Six days you shall labor, and do all your work,

20:10

But the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God.

On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter,

Your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock,

Or the sojourner who is within your gates.

20:11

For in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them,

And rested on the seventh day.

Therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

20:12

Honor your father and your mother,

That your days may be long in the land that Yahweh your God is giving you.

20:13

You shall not murder.

20:14

You shall not commit adultery.

20:15

You shall not steal.

20:16

You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

20:17

You shall not covet your neighbor’s house;

You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife,

Or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey,

Or anything that is your neighbor’s.”

20:18

Now when all the people saw the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet

And the mountain 🔥 smoking, the people were afraid and trembled, and they stood far off

20:19

And said to Moses,

“You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, lest we die.”

20:20

Moses said to the people,

“Do not fear, for God has come to test you,

That the fear of him may be before you, that you may not sin.”

20:21

The people stood far off, while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.

20:22

And Yahweh said to Moses,

“Thus you shall say to the people of Israel:

‘You have seen for yourselves that I have talked with you from heaven.

20:23

You shall not make gods of silver to be with me,

Nor shall you make for yourselves gods of gold.

20:24

An altar of earth you shall make for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings,

Your sheep and your oxen.

In every place where I cause my name to be remembered I will come to you and bless you.

20:25

If you make me an altar of stone,

You shall not build it of hewn stones,

For if you wield your tool on it you profane it.

20:26

And you shall not go up by steps to my altar,

That your nakedness be not exposed on it.’”

In Exodus chapters 1–20, we walk alongside Israel as Yahweh delivers them from bondage, guides them through trials, and establishes His covenant ✡️ at Sinai. The remnant theme runs deep — those who remain faithful, who follow Yahweh’s voice, and who uphold His command ⚖️s are marked as His holy people. These stories are not just ancient records but prophetic blueprints for us: they teach us about deliverance, obedience, holiness, and preparation for the greater promises to come.



🔥 Remnant Reflections:

- How does Yahweh reveal His power in your life?

- What does it mean today to be set apart as His holy nation?

- How can we uphold covenant ✡️ faithfulness in modern times?



May this scroll 📜 strengthen your faith and deepen your understanding.

Through the first 20 chapters of Exodus, Yahweh unfolds His covenant ✡️ plan, redeeming His people, demonstrating His unmatched power, and preparing the remnant to receive His law and walk in holiness. Each plague 🔥, sign, and command ⚖️ carries prophetic meaning — pointing both backward to the promises made to the patriarchs and forward to the Messiah. The remnant today is called to remember, to heed Yahweh’s voice, and to live as a holy nation set apart.



📜 Chapter 21 – Laws of Justice and Mercy

שמות כ״א – חֻקֵּי צֶדֶק וְרַחֲמִים



21:1

“Now these are the rules that you shall set before them.

21:2

When you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years,

and in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing.

→ Prophetic insight: Yahweh builds rhythms of freedom into the law.

→ Remnant lesson: Remember, no bondage is meant to be permanent under God’s design.

21:3

If he comes in single, he shall go out single;

if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him.

21:4

If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters,

the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out alone.

21:5

But if the slave plainly says,

‘I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,’

21:6

then his master shall bring him to God, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost.

And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl,

and he shall be his slave forever.

→ Hebrew: עֶבֶד (Eved) → Servant, slave.

→ Prophetic insight: Willing servanthood reflects covenant ✡️ love.

→ Remnant lesson: Freedom includes the choice to serve in love.

21:7

When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do.

21:8

If she does not please her master, who has designated her for himself,

then he shall let her be redeemed.

He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has broken faith with her.

21:9

If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her as with a daughter.

21:10

If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights.

21:11

And if he does not do these three things for her,

she shall go out for nothing, without payment of money.

21:12

Whoever strikes a man so that he dies shall be put to death.

21:13

But if he did not lie in wait for him, but God let him fall into his hand,

then I will appoint for you a place to which he may flee.

21:14

But if a man willfully attacks another to kill him by cunning,

you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.

21:15

Whoever strikes his father or his mother shall be put to death.

21:16

Whoever steals a man and sells him,

and anyone found in possession of him, shall be put to death.

21:17

Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death.

21:18

When men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist

and the man does not die but takes to his bed,

21:19

then if the man rises again and walks outdoors with his staff,

he who struck him shall be clear; only he shall pay for the loss of his time,

and shall have him thoroughly healed.

21:20

When a man strikes his slave, male or female, with a rod

and the slave dies under his hand, he shall be avenged.

21:21

But if the slave survives a day or two, he is not to be avenged,

for the slave is his money.

21:22

When men strive together and hit a pregnant woman, so that her children come out,

but there is no harm, the one who hit her shall surely be fined,

as the woman’s husband shall impose on him, and he shall pay as the judges determine.

21:23

But if there is harm, then you shall pay life for life,

21:24

eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

21:25

burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

→ Prophetic insight: Justice measures reflect both restraint and accountability.

→ Remnant lesson: Yahweh demands proportionate justice, not unchecked vengeance.

21:26

When a man strikes the eye of his slave, male or female, and destroys it,

he shall let the slave go free because of his eye.

21:27

If he knocks out the tooth of his slave, male or female,

he shall let the slave go free because of his tooth.

21:28

When an ox gores a man or a woman to death,

the ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten,

but the owner of the ox shall not be liable.

21:29

But if the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past,

and its owner has been warned but has not kept it in,

and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.

21:30

If a ransom is imposed on him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life

whatever is imposed on him.

21:31

If it gores a man’s son or daughter, he shall be dealt with according to this same rule.

21:32

If the ox gores a slave, male or female,

the owner shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver,

and the ox shall be stoned.

21:33

When a man opens a pit, or when a man digs a pit and does not cover it,

and an ox or a donkey falls into it,

21:34

the owner of the pit shall make restoration.

He shall give money to its owner, and the dead beast shall be his.

21:35

When one man’s ox butts another’s, so that it dies,

then they shall sell the live ox and share its price,

and the dead beast also they shall share.

21:36

Or if it is known that the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past,

and its owner has not kept it in, he shall repay ox for ox,

and the dead beast shall be his.

22:10

If a man gives to his neighbor a donkey or an ox or a sheep or any beast to keep safe,

and worship from afar.

Moses alone shall come near to Yahweh,

but the others shall not come near, and the people shall not come up with him.”

Moses came and told the people all the words of Yahweh and all the rules.

And all the people answered with one voice and said,

“All the words that Yahweh has spoken we will do.”

24:4

And Moses wrote down all the words of Yahweh.

He rose early in the morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain 🔥,

and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

24:5

And he sent young men of the people of Israel,

who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to Yahweh.

24:6

And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins,

and half of the blood he threw against the altar.

24:7

Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people.

And they said, “All that Yahweh has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient.”

And he did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel;

they beheld God, and ate and drank.

24:12

Yahweh said to Moses,

“Come up to me on the mountain 🔥 and wait there,

that I may give you the tablets of stone,

with the law and the command ⚖️ment, which I have written for their instruction.”

24:13

So Moses rose with his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up into the mountain 🔥 of God.

24:14

And he said to the elders,

“Wait here for us until we return to you.

And behold, Aaron and Hur are with you.

Whoever has a dispute, let him go to them.”

24:15

Then Moses went up on the mountain 🔥, and the cloud covered the mountain 🔥.

of what remains in the length of the curtains of the tent,

for fitting together; so shall you do for all the frames of the Mishkan.

26:18

You shall make the frames for the Mishkan: twenty frames for the south side.

26:19

And you shall make forty bases of silver under the twenty frames,

two bases under one frame for its two tenons,

and two bases under the next frame for its two tenons.

26:20

And for the second side of the Mishkan, on the north side twenty frames,

26:21

and their forty bases of silver, two bases under one frame,

and two bases under the next frame.

26:22

And for the rear of the Mishkan westward you shall make six frames.

26:23

And you shall make two frames for corners of the Mishkan in the rear.

26:33

And you shall hang the veil from the clasps,

and bring the ark of the testimony in there within the veil.

And the veil shall separate for you the Holy Place from the Most Holy.

→ Hebrew: קֹדֶשׁ הַקֳּדָשִׁים (Kodesh ha-Kodashim) → Holy of Holies.

→ Prophetic insight: A sacred boundary divides the earthly from the intensely divine.

→ Remnant lesson: Only by Yahweh’s invitation can one enter the holiest spaces.

26:34

You shall put the mercy seat on the ark of the testimony in the Most Holy Place.

26:35

And you shall set the table outside the veil,

and the lampstand on the south side of the Mishkan opposite the table;

28:2

And you shall make set-apart (holy) garments for Aharon your brother,

for glory and for beauty.

28:3

28:10

six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the remaining six on the other stone,

As a jeweler engraves signets, so shall you engrave the two stones

with the names of the sons of Yisrael.

You shall enclose them in settings of gold filigree.

28:12

And you shall set the two stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod,

as stones of remembrance for the sons of Yisrael.

And Aharon shall bear their names before Yahweh on his two shoulders for remembrance.

→ Hebrew: זִכָּרוֹן (zikaron) → memorial, remembrance.

→ Prophetic insight: The priest bears the people continually before the presence of Yahweh.

28:13

You shall make settings of gold filigree,

28:14

and two chains of pure gold, twisted like cords;

and you shall attach the corded chains to the settings.

28:15

You shall make a breastpiece of judgment (choshen mishpat),

in skilled work.

In the style of the ephod you shall make it — of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarns,

and fine twisted linen shall you make it.

28:16

It shall be square and doubled, a span its length and a span its breadth.

28:17

You shall set in it four rows of stones.

A row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle shall be the first row;

28:18

and the second row an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond;

You shall make two rings of gold,

and put them at the two ends of the breastpiece,

on its inside edge next to the ephod.

28:27

And you shall make two rings of gold,

and attach them in front to the lower part of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod,

at its seam above the skillfully woven band of the ephod.

28:28

And they shall bind the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue,

so that it may lie on the skillfully woven band of the ephod,

so that the breastpiece shall not come loose from the ephod.

So Aharon shall bear the names of the sons of Yisrael in the breastpiece of judgment

on his heart, when he goes into the set-apart place,

to bring them to continual remembrance before Yahweh.

28:30

And in the breastpiece of judgment you shall put the Urim and the Thummim,

and they shall be on Aharon’s heart,

when he goes in before Yahweh.

Thus Aharon shall bear the judgment of the children of Yisrael on his heart before Yahweh continually.

→ Hebrew: אוּרִים וְתוּמִים (Urim ve’Tummim) → lights and perfections.

→ Prophetic insight: Divine discernment comes through Yahweh’s appointed means.

28:31

“You shall make the robe (me’il) of the ephod all of blue (techelet).

28:32

It shall have an opening for the head in the middle of it,

with a woven binding around the opening,

like the opening in a garment, so that it may not tear.

28:33

On its hem you shall make pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarns,

around its hem, with bells of gold between them,

28:34

a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate,

around the hem of the robe.

→ Prophetic insight: Every movement of the priest was heard — Yahweh’s servant walks in audible holiness.

→ Remnant lesson: Our service before Yahweh carries a visible and audible testimony.

28:35

And it shall be on Aharon when he ministers,

and its sound shall be heard when he goes into the set-apart place before Yahweh,

and when he comes out, so that he does not die.

28:36

You shall make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it, like the engraving of a signet:

‘Set-Apart to Yahweh’ (קֹדֶשׁ לַיהוה, Kodesh L’YHWH).

28:37

And you shall fasten it on the turban (mitznefet) by a cord of blue.

It shall be on the front of the turban.

28:38

It shall be on Aharon’s forehead,

and Aharon shall bear any guilt from the set-apart things

that the children of Yisrael consecrate as their set-apart gifts.

It shall regularly be on his forehead, that they may be accepted before Yahweh.

28:39

You shall weave the tunic (ketonet) in checker work of fine linen,

and you shall make a turban (mitznefet) of fine linen,

and you shall make a sash (avnet), embroidered with needlework.

28:40

For Aharon’s sons you shall make tunics and sashes and caps.

You shall make them for glory and beauty.

28:41

And you shall put them on Aharon your brother,

and on his sons with him,

and shall anoint them and ordain them and consecrate them,

that they may serve me as kohanim (priests).

28:42

You shall make for them linen undergarments to cover their naked flesh.

They shall reach from the hips to the thighs.

28:43

And they shall be on Aharon and on his sons

when they go into the Ohel Mo’ed (Tent of Meeting)

or when they come near the altar to minister in the set-apart place,

lest they bear guilt and die.

This shall be a statute forever for him and for his offspring after him.

29:13

You shall take all the fat that covers the entrails,

and the long lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them,

and burn them on the altar.

29:14

But the flesh of the bull, and its skin, and its dung,

you shall burn with fire outside the camp;

it is a sin offering.

29:15

Then you shall take one of the rams,

and Aharon and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram.

29:16

You shall kill the ram and take its blood

and throw it against the sides of the altar.

29:17

Then you shall cut the ram into pieces,

and wash its entrails and its legs,

and put them with its pieces and its head,

29:18

and burn the whole ram on the altar.

It is a burnt offering to Yahweh.

It is a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to Yahweh.

and Aharon and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram.

29:20

29:24

You shall put all these on the palms of Aharon and on the palms of his sons,

and wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh.

29:25

Then you shall take them from their hands and burn them on the altar

on top of the burnt offering, as a pleasing aroma before Yahweh.

It is a food offering to Yahweh.

29:26

You shall take the breast of the ram of Aharon’s ordination

and it shall be your portion.

29:27

You shall consecrate the breast of the wave offering that is waved

and the thigh of the priests’ portion that is contributed

from the ram of ordination, from what was Aharon’s and his sons’.

29:28

It shall be for Aharon and his sons as a perpetual due from the children of Yisrael,

for it is a contribution.

It shall be a contribution from the children of Yisrael

from their peace offerings, their contribution to Yahweh.

29:29

The set-apart garments of Aharon shall be for his sons after him;

29:31

You shall take the ram of ordination and boil its flesh in a set-apart place.

29:32

Aharon and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread

that is in the basket at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.

They shall eat those things with which atonement was made at their ordination and consecration,

but an outsider shall not eat of them, because they are set-apart.

29:34

And if any of the flesh for the ordination or of the bread remains until the morning,

then you shall burn the remainder with fire.

It shall not be eaten, because it is set-apart.

29:35

Thus you shall do to Aharon and to his sons, according to all that I have command ⚖️ed you.

Through seven days shall you ordain them,

29:36

and every day you shall offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement.

Also you shall purify the altar when you make atonement for it,

and shall anoint it to consecrate it.

29:37

Seven days you shall make atonement for the altar and consecrate it,

and the altar shall be most set-apart.

Whatever touches the altar shall become set-apart.

29:38

Now this is what you shall offer on the altar:

two lambs a year old, day by day, regularly.

29:39

One lamb you shall offer in the morning,

and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight.

29:40

And with the first lamb a tenth seah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil,

and a fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering.

29:41

The other lamb you shall offer at twilight,

and shall offer with it a grain offering and its drink offering,

as in the morning, for a pleasing aroma, a food offering to Yahweh.

29:42

It shall be a regular burnt offering throughout your generations

at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting before Yahweh,

where I will meet with you, to speak to you there.

29:43

There I will meet with the children of Yisrael,

and it shall be set-apart by my glory.

29:44

I will consecrate the Tent of Meeting and the altar;

Aharon also and his sons I will consecrate to serve me as kohanim.

29:45

I will dwell among the children of Yisrael and will be their Elohim.

30:13

This they shall give:

to make atonement for your souls.

30:16

You shall take the atonement money from the children of Yisrael

and shall appoint it for the service of the Ohel Mo’ed (Tent of Meeting),

and you shall set it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar,

and you shall put water in it,

30:19

with which Aharon and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet.

30:24

and consecrate them,

that they may serve me as kohanim.

30:31

You shall speak to Bnei Yisrael, saying,

30:32

It shall not be poured on human flesh,

and you shall make no other like it in composition;

it is set-apart, and it shall be set-apart to you.

30:33

Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it on an outsider,

shall be cut off from his people.’”

30:34

Yahweh said to Moshe,

“Take fragrant spices:

stacte, onycha, galbanum, sweet spices with pure frankincense —

equal parts.

30:35

You shall make of these a fragrant incense,

blended as by the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and set-apart.

30:36

You shall beat some of it very small,

and put part of it before the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting,

where I will meet with you;

it shall be most set-apart for you.

30:37

The incense that you shall make,

you shall not make for yourselves according to its composition;

it shall be set-apart to you for Yahweh.

30:38

Whoever makes any like it to use as perfume

shall be cut off from his people.”

Yahweh (יְהוָה) spoke to Moshe (מֹשֶׁה), saying,

31:2

“See, I have called by name Betzal’el (בְּצַלְאֵל) son of Uri (אוּרִי), son of Hur (חוּר),

of the tribe of Yehudah (יְהוּדָה).

31:3

I have filled him with the Ruach Elohim (רוּחַ אֱלֹהִים),

with chokhmah (חָכְמָה, wisdom), tevunah (תְּבוּנָה, understanding),

and da’at (דַּעַת, knowledge),

and with all manner of craftsmanship.

31:4

To devise artistic designs,

to work in zahav (זָהָב, gold), kesef (כֶּסֶף, silver), and nechoshet (נְחֹשֶׁת, bronze),

31:5

in cutting avanim (אֲבָנִים, stones) for setting,

and in carving wood,

to work in all manner of craftsmanship.

→ Prophetic insight: The Spirit (רוּחַ) empowers not only prophecy but also holy craftsmanship.

→ Remnant lesson: You are called to carry wisdom into your creative work — not just religious rituals.

31:6

And behold, I have appointed with him Oholiav (אָהֳלִיאָב) son of Achisamakh (אֲחִיסָמָךְ),

of the tribe of Dan (דָּן).

And in the hearts of all who are wise-hearted (חַכְמֵי־לֵב),

I have put chokhmah,

that they may make all that I have command ⚖️ed you:

31:7

The Ohel Mo’ed (אֹהֶל מוֹעֵד, Tent of Meeting),

the Aron ha-Edut (אֲרוֹן הָעֵדוּת, Ark of the Testimony),

the kapporet (כַּפֹּרֶת, mercy seat) that is on it,

and all the furnishings of the Ohel,

31:8

the shulchan (שֻׁלְחָן, table) and its vessels,

the menorah (מְנוֹרָה) of pure gold with all its vessels,

the Mizbeach (מִזְבֵּחַ, altar) of incense,

31:9

the Mizbeach of burnt offering with all its vessels,

the kiyor (כִּיּוֹר, basin) and its stand,

31:10

the woven garments,

the set-apart garments for Aharon (אַהֲרֹן) the kohen (כֹּהֵן, priest),

and the garments of his sons, to serve as kohanim (כֹּהֲנִים),

31:11

and the shemen ha-mishchah (שֶׁמֶן הַמִּשְׁחָה, anointing oil),

and the ketoret ha-samim (קְטֹרֶת הַסַּמִּים, fragrant incense) for the set-apart place.

According to all that I have command ⚖️ed you they shall do.”

31:12

Yahweh spoke to Moshe, saying,

31:13

“Speak also to Bnei Yisrael (בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל), saying,

‘Surely you shall keep my Shabbatot (שַׁבְּתוֹת),

for it is an ot (אוֹת, sign) between me and you throughout your generations,

that you may know that I, Yahweh, sanctify you (מְקַדִּשְׁכֶם).

31:14

You shall keep the Shabbat (שַׁבָּת), because it is set-apart (קֹדֶשׁ) to you.

Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death;

for whoever does any melachah (מְלָאכָה, work) on it,

that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

31:15

Six days shall melachah be done,

but on the seventh day is a Shabbat shabbaton (שַׁבַּת שַׁבָּתוֹן, complete rest),

set-apart to Yahweh.

Whoever does melachah on the day of the Shabbat shall surely be put to death.

31:16

Therefore Bnei Yisrael shall keep the Shabbat,

to observe the Shabbat throughout their generations, as a covenant ✡️ olam (עוֹלָם, forever).

31:17

It is an ot (sign) forever between me and Bnei Yisrael,

for in six days Yahweh made the heavens and the earth,

and on the seventh day he ceased (שָׁבַת, shavat) and was refreshed (וַיִּנָּפַשׁ, vayinafash).”

31:18

And when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai (הַר סִינַי),

he gave Moshe the two luchot ha-edut (לוּחוֹת הָעֵדוּת, tablets of testimony),

tablets of stone, written with the finger of Elohim (אֱלֹהִים).



📜 Chapter 32 – The Golden Calf

שמות ל״ב – הָעֵגֶל הַזָּהָב



32:1

When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain 🔥, they gathered around Aaron and said,

“Up, make us gods who shall go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.”

→ Hebrew: עֲשֵׂה־לָנוּ אֱלֹהִים (Aseh-lanu Elohim) → Make us gods.

→ Prophetic insight: Impatience can open the door to idolatry.

→ Remnant lesson: Wait on Yahweh even when leadership seems absent.

32:2

So Aaron said to them,

“Take off the rings of gold that are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.”

32:3

So all the people took off the rings of gold that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron.

32:4

And he received the gold from their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and made a golden calf.

And they said,

“These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!”

→ Hebrew: עֵגֶל זָהָב (Egel Zahav) → Golden calf.

→ Prophetic insight: False worship often mimics past deliverance.

→ Remnant lesson: Reject substitutes; only Yahweh is the deliverer.

32:5

When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made a proclamation and said,

“Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh.”

32:6

And they rose up early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings.

And the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.

→ Prophetic insight: False worship mixes truth with corruption.

→ Remnant lesson: Discern holy feasts from corrupted celebrations.

32:7

And Yahweh said to Moses,

“Go down, for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.”

32:8

“They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I command ⚖️ed them;

they have made for themselves a golden calf and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it and said,

‘These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!’”

32:9

And Yahweh said to Moses,

“I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.”

→ Hebrew: עַם־קְשֵׁה־עֹרֶף (Am q’sheh oref) → Stiff-necked people.

→ Prophetic insight: Yahweh sees the heart posture.

→ Remnant lesson: Humble your heart before Yahweh.

32:10

“Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them,

in order that I may make a great nation of you.”

32:11

But Moses implored Yahweh his God and said,

“O Yahweh, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?”

32:12

“Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent did he bring them out, to kill them in the mountain 🔥s and to consume them from the face of the earth’?

Turn from your burning anger and relent from this disaster against your people.”

32:13

“Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants,

to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them,

‘I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven,

and all this land that I have promised I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.’”

→ Prophetic insight: Intercession calls on Yahweh’s covenant ✡️ memory.

→ Remnant lesson: Stand in the gap with covenant ✡️ promises.

32:14

📜 Chapter 33 – Moses Seeks YHWH’s Presence

שמות ל״ג – מֹשֶׁה מְבַקֵּשׁ פְּנֵי יְהוָה



33:1

Yahweh said to Moses,

“Depart; go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt,

to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘To your offspring I will give it.’”

33:2

“I will send an angel ⚔️ before you,

and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.”

33:3

“Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey;

but I will not go up among you, lest I consume you on the way, for you are a stiff-necked people.”

→ Hebrew: עַם־קְשֵׁה־עֹרֶף (Am q’sheh oref) → Stiff-necked people.

→ Prophetic insight: Yahweh’s holiness demands purity in His presence.

→ Remnant lesson: Seek Yahweh’s presence, not just His promises.

33:4

When the people heard this disastrous word, they mourned,

and no one put on his ornaments.

33:5

For Yahweh had said to Moses,

“Say to the people of Israel, ‘You are a stiff-necked people;

if for a single moment I should go up among you, I would consume you.

So now take off your ornaments, that I may know what to do with you.’”

33:6

Therefore the people of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward.

33:7

Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp,

and he called it the tent of meeting.

And everyone who sought Yahweh would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.

33:8

Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise up,

and each would stand at his tent door, and watch Moses until he had gone into the tent.

33:9

When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent,

and Yahweh would speak with Moses.

→ Hebrew: עָנָן (Anan) → Cloud.

→ Prophetic insight: Yahweh’s presence visibly marks sacred space.

→ Remnant lesson: Honor where Yahweh’s presence dwells.

33:10

And when all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent,

all the people would rise up and worship, each at his tent door.

33:11

Thus Yahweh used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend.

When Moses turned again into the camp, his assistant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent.

33:12

Moses said to Yahweh,

“See, you say to me, ‘Bring up this people,’ but you have not let me know whom you will send with me.

Yet you have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.’”

33:13

“Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways,

that I may know you in order to find favor in your sight. Consider too that this nation is your people.”

33:14

And he said, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”

→ Hebrew: פָּנֶיךָ (Paneikha) → Your presence.

→ Prophetic insight: Yahweh’s presence is the real source of rest.

→ Remnant lesson: Don’t move forward without Yahweh.

33:15

And he said to him,

“If your presence will not go with me, do not bring us up from here.”

33:16

“For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people?

Is it not in your going with us, so that we are distinct, I and your people, from every other people on the face of the earth?”

33:17

And Yahweh said to Moses,

“This very thing that you have spoken I will do, for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.”

33:18

Moses said, “Please show me your glory.”

→ Hebrew: כָּבוֹד (Kavod) → Glory.

→ Prophetic insight: A longing heart asks to see Yahweh’s majesty.

→ Remnant lesson: Seek deeper revelation of His glory.

33:19

And he said,

“I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name ‘Yahweh.’

And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.”

33:20

“But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live.”

33:21

And Yahweh said,

“Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock,

33:22

and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock,

and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by.”

33:23

“Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen.”



📜 Chapter 34 – New Tablets and Covenant Renewal

שמות ל״ד – לוּחוֹת חֲדָשִׁים וְחִדּוּשׁ הַבְּרִית



34:1

Yahweh said to Moses,

“Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first,

and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.”

34:2

“Be ready by the morning,

and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai,

and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain.”

34:3

“No one shall come up with you,

and let no one be seen throughout all the mountain.

Let no flocks or herds graze opposite that mountain.”

34:4

So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the first.

And he rose early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai,

as Yahweh had command ⚖️ed him,

and took in his hand two tablets of stone.

34:5

Yahweh descended in the cloud and stood with him there,

and proclaimed the name of Yahweh.

34:6

Yahweh passed before him and proclaimed,

“Yahweh, Yahweh, a God merciful and gracious,

slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness,”

“keeping steadfast love for thousands,

forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin,

but who will by no means clear the guilty,

visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children’s children,

to the third and the fourth generation.”

34:8

And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped.

34:9

And he said,

“If now I have found favor in your sight, O יהוה,

please let the יהוה go in the midst of us,

for it is a stiff-necked people,

and pardon our iniquity and our sin,

and take us for your inheritance.”

34:10

And he said,

“Behold, I am making a covenant ✡️.

Before all your people I will do marvels,

such as have not been created in all the earth or in any nation.

And all the people among whom you are shall see the work of Yahweh,

for it is an awesome thing that I will do with you.”

→ Hebrew: בְּרִית (Brit) → Covenant.

→ Prophetic insight: Yahweh’s covenant ✡️s are accompanied by wonders.

→ Remnant lesson: Expect Yahweh’s wonders to accompany His promises.

34:11

“Observe what I command ⚖️ you this day.

Behold, I will drive out before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites,

the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.”

34:12

“Take care, lest you make a covenant ✡️ with the inhabitants of the land to which you go,

lest it become a snare in your midst.”

34:13

“You shall tear down their altars and break their pillars and cut down their Asherim.”

34:14

“For you shall worship no other god,

for Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.”

and you are invited, you eat of his sacrifice,”

34:16

“and you take of their daughters for your sons,

and their daughters whore after their gods

and make your sons whore after their gods.”

34:17

“You shall not make for yourself any gods of cast metal.”

34:18

“You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread.

Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I command ⚖️ed you,

at the time appointed in the month Abib,

for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.”

34:19

“All that open the womb are mine,

all your male livestock, the firstborn of cow and sheep.”

34:20

“The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb,

or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck.

All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem.

And none shall appear before me empty-handed.”

34:21

“Six days you shall work,

but on the seventh day you shall rest.

In plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.”

34:22

“You shall observe the Feast of Weeks, the firstfruits of wheat harvest,

and the Feast of Ingathering at the year’s end.”

34:23

“Three times in the year shall all your males appear before the יהוה Yahweh, the God of Israel.”

34:24

“For I will cast out nations before you and enlarge your borders;

no one shall covet your land,

when you go up to appear before Yahweh your God three times in the year.”

34:25

“You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with anything leavened,

or let the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover remain until the morning.”

34:26

“The best of the firstfruits of your ground you shall bring to the house of Yahweh your God.

You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.”

34:27

And Yahweh said to Moses,

“Write these words,

for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant ✡️ with you and with Israel.”

34:28

So he was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights.

He neither ate bread nor drank water.

And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant ✡️, the Ten Commandments.

34:29

When Moses came down from Mount Sinai,

with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand as he came down from the mountain 🔥,

Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God.

→ Hebrew: קָרַן (Qaran) → Shone, radiated.

→ Prophetic insight: Encounters with Yahweh leave a visible mark.

→ Remnant lesson: Let His presence shine through you.

34:30

Aaron and all the people of Israel saw Moses, and behold, the skin of his face shone,

and they were afraid to come near him.

34:31

But Moses called to them,

and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him,

and Moses talked with them.

34:32

Afterward all the people of Israel came near,

and he command ⚖️ed them all that Yahweh had spoken with him in Mount Sinai.

34:33

And when Moses had finished speaking with them,

he put a veil over his face.

34:34

Whenever Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him,

he would remove the veil, until he came out.

And when he came out and told the people of Israel what he was command ⚖️ed,

34:35

the people of Israel would see the face of Moses,

that the skin of Moses’ face was shining.

And Moses would put the veil over his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

שמות ל״ה – שַׁבָּת וּתְרוּמוֹת לַמִּשְׁכָּן



35:1

Moses assembled all the congregation of the people of Israel and said to them,

“These are the things that Yahweh has command ⚖️ed you to do.”

Contributions for the Tabernacle

35:4

Moses said to all the congregation of the people of Israel,

“This is the thing that Yahweh has command ⚖️ed.”

35:5

“Take from among you a contribution to Yahweh.

Whoever is of a generous heart, let him bring Yahweh’s contribution:

gold, silver, and bronze;

35:6

blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen;

goats’ hair,

35:7

tanned rams’ skins, and goatskins;

acacia wood,

35:8

oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,

35:9

and onyx stones and stones for setting, for the ephod and for the breastpiece.”

Skilled Craftsmen

35:10

“Let every skillful craftsman among you come and make all that Yahweh has command ⚖️ed:

35:11

the tabernacle 🕎, its tent and its covering, its hooks and its frames, its bars, its pillars, and its bases;

35:12

the ark with its poles, the mercy seat, and the veil of the screen;

35:13

the table with its poles and all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;

35:14

the lampstand also for the light, with its utensils and its lamps, and the oil for the light;

35:15

and the altar of incense, with its poles, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense,

the pegs of the tabernacle 🕎 and the pegs of the court, and their cords;

35:19

the finely worked garments for ministering in the Holy Place,

the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, for their service as priests.”

35:20

Then all the congregation of the people of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.

35:21

And they came, everyone whose heart stirred him,

and everyone whose spirit moved him,

and brought Yahweh’s contribution to be used for the tent of meeting,

and for all its service, and for the holy garments.

→ Hebrew: נָדִיב לֵב (Nadiv lev) → Generous heart.

→ Prophetic insight: True offering flows from the heart.

→ Remnant lesson: Give as Yahweh moves you, not under compulsion.

35:22

So they came, both men and women.

All who were of a willing heart brought brooches and earrings and signet rings and armlets, all sorts of gold objects,

every man dedicating an offering of gold to Yahweh.

35:23

And every one who possessed blue or purple or scarlet yarns or fine linen or goats’ hair or tanned rams’ skins or goatskins brought them.

35:24

Everyone who could make a contribution of silver or bronze brought it as Yahweh’s contribution.

And every one who possessed acacia wood of any use in the work brought it.

35:25

And every skillful woman spun with her hands,

and they all brought what they had spun in blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen.

35:26

All the women whose hearts stirred them to use their skill spun the goats’ hair.

35:27

And the leaders brought onyx stones and stones to be set, for the ephod and for the breastpiece,

35:28

and spices and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense.

35:29

All the men and women, the people of Israel, whose heart moved them to bring anything for the work that Yahweh had command ⚖️ed by Moses to be done,

brought it as a freewill offering to Yahweh.

Bezalel and Oholiab

35:30

Then Moses said to the people of Israel,

“See, Yahweh has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;

35:31

and he has filled him with the Spirit of God,

with skill, with intelligence, with knowledge, and with all craftsmanship,

35:32

to devise artistic designs, to work in gold and silver and bronze,

35:33

in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, for work in every skilled craft.

35:34

And he has inspired him to teach, both him and Oholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan.

35:35

He has filled them with skill to do every sort of work done by an engraver or by a designer or by an embroiderer in blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen,

or by a weaver — by any sort of workman or skilled designer.”



📜 Chapter 36 – Skilled Workers Build the Tabernacle

שמות ל״ו – הָאֻמָּנִים בּוֹנִים אֶת הַמִּשְׁכָּן



36:1

“Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whom Yahweh has put skill and intelligence

to know how to do any work in the construction of the sanctuary

shall work in accordance with all that Yahweh has command ⚖️ed.”

36:2

And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whose mind Yahweh had put skill,

everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to do the work.

36:3

And they received from Moses all the contribution that the people of Israel had brought

for doing the work on the sanctuary.

They still kept bringing him freewill offerings every morning,

36:4

so that all the craftsmen who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came,

each from the task that he was doing,

36:5

and said to Moses,

“The people bring much more than enough for doing the work that Yahweh has command ⚖️ed us to do.”

→ Prophetic insight: When Yahweh’s people are stirred, there is overflow.

→ Remnant lesson: Sometimes abundance requires knowing when to stop gathering.

36:6

So Moses gave command ⚖️, and word was proclaimed throughout the camp,

“Let no man or woman do anything more for the contribution for the sanctuary.”

So the people were restrained from bringing,

36:7

for the material they had was sufficient to do all the work, and more.

Construction of the Tabernacle

36:8

And all the craftsmen among the workmen made the tabernacle 🕎 with ten curtains;

they were made of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet yarns,

with cherubim skillfully worked.

36:9

The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits;

all the curtains were the same size.

36:10

He coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled to one another.

36:11

He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain of the first set.

Likewise, he made them on the edge of the outermost curtain of the second set.

36:12

He made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set;

the loops were opposite one another.

36:13

And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to the other with clasps.

So the tabernacle 🕎 was a single whole.

36:14

He also made curtains of goats’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle 🕎;

he made eleven curtains.

36:15

The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits.

The eleven curtains were the same size.

36:16

He coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.

36:17

And he made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain of the one set,

and fifty loops on the edge of the other connecting curtain.

36:18

And he made fifty clasps of bronze to couple the tent together that it might be a single whole.

36:19

And he made for the tent a covering of tanned rams’ skins and goatskins.

36:20

Then he made the upright frames for the tabernacle 🕎 of acacia wood.

36:21

Ten cubits was the length of a frame, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each frame.

36:22

Each frame had two tenons for fitting together.

He did this for all the frames of the tabernacle 🕎.

36:23

The frames for the tabernacle 🕎 he made thus: twenty frames for the south side.

36:24

And he made forty bases of silver under the twenty frames,

two bases under one frame for its two tenons,

and two bases under the next frame for its two tenons.

36:25

For the second side of the tabernacle 🕎, on the north side, he made twenty frames

36:26

and their forty bases of silver, two bases under one frame,

and two bases under the next frame.

36:27

For the rear of the tabernacle 🕎 westward he made six frames.

36:28

He made two frames for corners of the tabernacle 🕎 in the rear.

“On the first day of the first month you shall erect the tabernacle 🕎 of the tent of meeting.”

40:3

“And you shall put in it the ark of the testimony,

and you shall screen the ark with the veil.”

and hang up the screen for the gate of the court.”

40:9

“Then you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle 🕎 and all that is in it,

and consecrate it and all its furniture, so that it may become holy.”

→ Hebrew: מָשַׁח (Mashach) → Anoint.

→ Prophetic insight: Anointing marks objects and people as set apart for Yahweh.

“You shall also anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils,

and consecrate the altar, so that the altar may become most holy.”

40:11

“You shall also anoint the basin and its stand, and consecrate it.”

40:12

“Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting,

and shall wash them with water,”

40:13

“and put on Aaron the holy garments.

And you shall anoint him and consecrate him,

that he may serve me as priest.”

40:14

“You shall bring his sons also and put coats on them,”

40:15

“and anoint them, as you anointed their father,

that they may serve me as priests.

And their anointing shall admit them to a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations.”

40:16

This Moses did; according to all that Yahweh command ⚖️ed him, so he did.

40:17

In the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month,

the tabernacle 🕎 was erected.

40:18

Moses erected the tabernacle 🕎.

He laid its bases, and set up its frames, and put in its poles, and raised up its pillars.

40:19

And he spread the tent over the tabernacle 🕎,

and put the covering of the tent over it,

as Yahweh had command ⚖️ed Moses.

40:20

He took the testimony and put it into the ark,

and put the poles on the ark and set the mercy seat above on the ark.

40:21

And he brought the ark into the tabernacle 🕎 and set up the veil of the screen,

and screened the ark of the testimony,

as Yahweh had command ⚖️ed Moses.

40:22

He put the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle 🕎, outside the veil,

40:23

and arranged the bread on it before Yahweh,

as Yahweh had command ⚖️ed Moses.

40:24

He put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table, on the south side of the tabernacle 🕎,

40:25

and set up the lamps before Yahweh,

as Yahweh had command ⚖️ed Moses.

40:26

He put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil,

40:27

and burned fragrant incense on it,

as Yahweh had command ⚖️ed Moses.

40:28

He put in place the screen for the door of the tabernacle 🕎.

40:29

And he set the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the tabernacle 🕎 of the tent of meeting,

and offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering,

as Yahweh had command ⚖️ed Moses.

40:30

He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar,

and put water in it for washing,

40:31

with which Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet.

40:32

When they went into the tent of meeting, and when they approached the altar,

they washed,

as Yahweh command ⚖️ed Moses.

40:33

And he erected the court around the tabernacle 🕎 and the altar,

and set up the screen of the gate of the court.

So Moses finished the work.

The Glory of Yahweh

40:34

Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting,

and the glory of Yahweh filled the tabernacle 🕎.

→ Hebrew: כְּבוֹד־יְהוָה (K’vod Yahweh) → Glory of Yahweh.

→ Prophetic insight: Yahweh’s manifest presence seals His work.

→ Remnant lesson: Yield space in your life for Yahweh’s glory to dwell.

40:35

And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting

because the cloud settled on it,

and the glory of Yahweh filled the tabernacle 🕎.

40:36

Throughout all their journeys,

whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle 🕎,

the people of Israel would set out.

40:37

But if the cloud was not taken up,

then they did not set out till the day that it was taken up.

40:38

For the cloud of Yahweh was on the tabernacle 🕎 by day,

and fire was in it by night,

in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys.

The Song of Exodus: A Remnant’s Cry ✨🌿

From the sands of Egypt we rise,

from the chains of Mitzrayim we break free.

Yahweh’s whisper becomes a thunder:

“I have called you by name — you are Mine.”

Through the parted seas we walk,

waters trembling at His voice.

The armies of darkness fall behind,

for Yahweh fights for His remnant.

On the mount we receive His covenant ✡️ fire,

etched in stone, burning in hearts.

Not law to bind —

but love to shape a holy people,

set apart, crowned in light.

In the wilderness we dwell,

beneath the cloud, beside the flame,

learning the way of trust,

learning the song of waiting,

learning the dance of presence and promise.

We are the living tabernacle 🕎s,

woven with threads of obedience and mercy,

marked by the glory between the cherubim,

marked by the Name — קֹדֶשׁ לַיהוָה — Holy to Yahweh.

We are the intercessors on the mountain 🔥,

the worshipers in the tent,

the warriors on the journey,

the remnant who refuse to bow to golden calves.

And as the cloud lifts, we will rise.

As the trumpet sounds, we will march.

As the final Exodus comes,

we will follow the Lamb who leads us home.

For Yahweh is our deliverer.

Yahweh is our light.

Yahweh is our rest.

Yahweh is our glory forever.

🔥 Remnant Insights from Exodus

🔥 Remnant Insight: Exodus 3 – The Burning Bush

YHWH reveals His name to Mosheh: 'Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh' (I AM THAT I AM). This is not merely a name—it is a declaration of timeless presence. To the remnant, it is a reminder that your calling may come in isolation, but it carries the weight of eternal flame. You are called not in comfort, but in consecration. The bush burns but is not consumed—just like the fire within the remnant.

🔥 Remnant Insight: Exodus 12 – The Passover

Pesach (Passover) was not simply a deliverance from Egypt, but an activation of identity. The blood on the doorposts represents divine covering for the set-apart. It is a symbol of obedience, trust, and separation. For the remnant, it teaches: Cover your gates with truth. Walk out of bondage not just physically, but mentally and spiritually. You are the called-out ones—the hidden ones marked by obedience.

🔥 Remnant Insight: Exodus 20 – The Commandments

These are not mere laws—they are the terms of covenant. Each utterance is a flame, burning into the DNA of a people set apart. To the remnant, the commandments restore rhythm with heaven. They align the body with purpose, the mind with Torah, and the soul with YHWH. Obedience is not religion—it is remembrance.

🔥 Remnant Insight: Exodus 25–31 – The Tabernacle

The Mishkan (Tabernacle) is a physical blueprint of heavenly truth. Its gold, incense, veils, and sacrifices teach spiritual geometry. The remnant understands this: you are the tabernacle. Sanctify your inner space. Let incense rise from your spirit, let your altar burn with truth. Guard the Ark—the covenant within.

🔥 Remnant Insight: Exodus 40 – The Glory Descends

When obedience is fulfilled, and the pattern followed, the Glory comes. Not by performance, but by presence. The cloud and fire descend as confirmation. To the remnant: your path is strange to the world, but sacred to heaven. Build as He commands, and the fire will fall.
