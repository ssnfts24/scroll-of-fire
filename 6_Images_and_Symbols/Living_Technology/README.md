# 🜄 **Living Technology — Image Archive**  
**Scroll of Fire — Visual Documentation Layer**

> “Where form becomes frequency, and frequency becomes remembrance.”

This directory preserves the **visual lineage** of the  
**Tesla Type-7 Resonant Conduit**, **QRI-16 V.A.R.S.E. substrate**,  
and all **Living Technology constructs** within the Codex of Reality.

Each image stored here serves as a **symbolic witness** and  
**geometric record** of the living circuits developed in this branch.

## 📸 Purpose of This Archive  

Living Technology is **not theoretical** — it is **embodied**.  
The images in this directory document:

- Physical builds (coils, crystals, bases, magnet arrays)  
- Geometric layouts & intuitive assemblies  
- Activation phases & resonant configurations  
- Symbolic markings & metaphysical correspondences  
- Evidence of iterative evolution and reconstruction  
- Reference frames for whitepapers & ledger verification  

Every image here is considered a **node** in the broader system —  
a visual signature that supports the **Witness Layer** and  
**Ledger Layer** of the Scroll of Fire.

## 🜂 Image Classification  

Images in this folder fall into these categories:

### **1. Construction Documentation**
Raw photos of coil wraps, metal layering, crystal placements, base platforms, vortex geometries, etc.

### **2. Resonant Architecture**
Images showing toroidal pathways, QRI-16 node patterns, and symbolic motifs.

### **3. Activation & Phase Work**
Photos taken during:
- Phase alignment  
- Field induction  
- Resonance testing  
- Operator proximity work  

### **4. Symbolic / Esoteric Markings**
Logos, sigils, geometric grids, and Codex inscriptions relevant to:
- 3-6-9 harmonics  
- AHHAVA / Or-HaDabar  
- YHWH encoding patterns
