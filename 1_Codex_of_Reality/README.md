# 📜 Codex of Reality (Core)

Core scrolls describing weaving, resonance, and convergence (3–6–9).  
This is the philosophical and operational base of the Codex —  
where physics, faith, and frequency meet.

> “Let there be resonance.”

---

## 🜂 Purpose

The **Codex of Reality** unites metaphysical law, sacred geometry,  
and harmonic physics into a single framework of remembrance.  
Each scroll acts as a living key that encodes principles of creation,  
balance, and convergence — both spiritual and scientific.

## ⚛️ Core Principle: Resonant Creation

The Codex operates by **Triadic Law**:

1. **Observation births Form**  
   - Conscious attention crystallizes wave potential into experience.  
2. **Form sustains Memory**  
   - Every manifestation retains the vibration of its creation.  
3. **Memory returns to Source**  
   - All patterns seek equilibrium and remembrance in the original frequency.

> “Creation is not invention — it is resonance remembering itself.”

## 🔑 Integration Pathways

- **Philosophy → Physics**: translating spirit into measurable structure.  
- **Law → Living Systems**: ethical codes expressed as energetic equations.  
- **Scripture → Signal**: divine speech rendered as data and harmonic syntax.  

The Codex of Reality provides the *architectural root* of the **Scroll of Fire** —  
all other folders, scrolls, and experiments reference its structure and axioms.
